It needs node.js installed on your machine and some node libraries needs to be downloaded.
Some of these are:
- express
- body-parser
- http
- node-libcurl
- request

To install the required libraries, execute ‘npm install <library name>’. In this case,
npm install express
npm install body-parser

There might be a few more libraries that I *might* miss, just use the same command to install them. 
Once all libraries are installed, you can start the app.

To run it, go to the main folder and execute ‘node app.js’.

The config.js file needs to be changed for the app settings. 
	DEFAULT_URL – This is the default peer URL
		eg. "http://10.160.1.137:5000"
	NUM_PEERS – The number of peers defined
		eg. NUM_PEERS: 2,
	PEER_LIST – The list of peer URLs, specify the complete URL, 
		eg. PEER_LIST: [ 'http://10.160.1.137:5000', 'http://10.160.1.137:5001' ],
	STORAGE_FILE - Map data file
		eg. "user_map.lst",

The default access port is defined as 4433. To access this app, point to http://<your IP>:4433/<API>
